#Project vision#

Data literacy is becoming increasingly important. We want to make Wikidata known as a primary means of teaching data literacy, and
to train people to understand and use it to create interesting projects, thereby creating a bigger Wikidata community in the UK.

#Welcome#

Thanks for coming to read about our project, we're really grateful to have more eyes on our idea so that we can collaboratively
understand how to achieve our goal.

I'm John, the Communications Coordinator for Wikimedia UK, the charity responsible for promoting Wikipedia and its sister projects like
Wikidata in the UK. I'm trying to write a communications strategy for how to promote WIkidata as a data literacy tool, and I need
your help!

Why not read our [Code of Conduct] here before going further.

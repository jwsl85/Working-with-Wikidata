# Project vision#

Data literacy is becoming increasingly important. We want to make Wikidata known as a primary means of teaching data literacy, and
to train people to understand and use it to create interesting projects, thereby creating a bigger Wikidata community in the UK.

## Welcome

Thanks for coming to read about our project, we're really grateful to have more eyes on our idea so that we can collaboratively
understand how to achieve our goal.

I'm John, the Communications Coordinator for Wikimedia UK, the charity responsible for promoting Wikipedia and its sister projects like
Wikidata in the UK. I'm trying to write a communications strategy for how to promote WIkidata as a data literacy tool, and I need
your help!

Why not read our [Code of Conduct] here before going further.

You can also read some of the resources I've already created here:

## Suggested contributions

We need to figure out who the stakeholders are we should be communicating with. These will likely include:

* Wikimedians already working with Wikidata
* Universities, specifically Data Science courses
* Institutions with datasets they might make open
* Coding clubs
* Data journalists

One of the best ways you can contribute at the moment is to suggest people who we should work with or approach as groups who might
want to use Wikidata as part of their workflow.

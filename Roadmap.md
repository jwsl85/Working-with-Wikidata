# Working-with-Wikidata

We aim to improve the recognition of Wikidata in the UK as the primary Open Access data repository, and for institutions teaching data
literacy to use Wiidata as a primary means of training people to understand how to work with data.

Milestone 2 - Conduct outreach and publicity to target thought leaders in data in the UK.

Milestone 3 - Organise Wikidata training sessions with interested groups.
